        <h1 class="centre-align">Deriving the quaternion product</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I spent a little time this week getting to grips with quaternions in order to better understand some
            orientation filters I was using at work. I had worked with quaternions before but never had the time to
            fully digest them and understand them deeply. That's not a position I like to be in as someone who thinks of
            themselves as a mathematician; using a mathematical tool without understanding it is iffy at the best of
            times, and I'm a big believer in learning for it's own sake anyway.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, my limited understanding led to a few simple tasks taking a lot longer than they should have. In
            the end I spent a morning reading (ok, skimming) a 150-page book on quaternions, following a few worked
            examples, proving a few theorems and properties, and felt much better about them.</p>
        <p>I decided to write up what I learned, and write a small library to do the work, in order to further cement
            and test my understanding. That work is presented here. I'll start with</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a defintion of quaternions,</li>
            <li>deriving the quaternion product.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In later articles I will discuss the creation of the C++ header-only quaternion library, and talk about the
            main practical use of quaternions: 3D rotations.</p>
        <h2>Quaternions</h2>
        <h3>Quaternion definition</h3>
        <p>Quaternions are an extension of the real numbers which introduces two new imaginary numbers, called j and k.
            These numbers are imaginary in the sense that they have the property \(\mathbf{j}^2 = -1, \mathbf{k}^2 =
            -1\), but they are not equal to the more familiar imaginary number \(\mathbf{i}\). The usual set of
            statements that define these numbers is as follows:</p>
        <div class="eq">
            $$
            \begin{align}
            &\mathbf{i}^2=\mathbf{j}^2=\mathbf{k}^2=\mathbf{ijk}=-1,\\[1em]
            &\mathbf{ij}=\mathbf k,\quad\mathbf{jk}=\mathbf i,\quad\mathbf{ki}=\mathbf j.
            \end{align}
            $$
        </div>
        <p>Quaternions in general are non-commutative, and in particular the products in equation 2 are in fact
            anti-commutative. This means that \(\mathbf{ij} = \mathbf k\) implies \(\mathbf{ji} = -\mathbf k\).</p>
        <p>A quaternion, then, is an element in a four-dimensional space where the standard basis vectors are the set
            \(\{1, \mathbf i, \mathbf j, \mathbf k\}\). In this document I will usually use the Cartesian notation which
            is exactly analogous to the Cartesian form of complex numbers. In this notation, a quaternion is given by
        </p>
        <div class="eq">
            $$
            \begin{equation}
            q = q_0+q_1\mathbf i+q_2\mathbf j+q_3\mathbf k.
            \end{equation}
            $$
        </div>
        <p>\(q_0\) may be called the real part or the scalar part of the quaternion, and the other elements taken
            together may be called the imaginary part or the vector part. A pure quaternion is one where the real part
            is equal to zero, and the identity quaternion has scalar part \(1\) and vector part \(\mathbf 0\).</p>
        <h3>Defining the quaternion product</h3>
        <p>Using the Cartesian form for quaternions, let's define two quaternions, \(p\) and \(q\), such that</p>
        <div class="eq">
            $$
            \begin{align}
            p&=p_0+p_1\mathbf i+p_2\mathbf j+p_3\mathbf k,\\[1em]
            q&=q_0+q_1\mathbf i+q_2\mathbf j+q_3\mathbf k.
            \end{align}
            $$
        </div>
        <p>On the assumption that multiplication is distributive over addition, we can expand the product \(pq\) to give
        </p>
        <div class="eq">
            $$
            \begin{align}
            \nonumber pq &= \left(p_0+p_1\mathbf i+p_2\mathbf j+p_3\mathbf k\right)\left(q_0+q_1\mathbf i+q_2\mathbf
            j+q_3\mathbf k\right)\\[1em]
            \notag &= p_0q_0+p_0q_1\mathbf i+p_0q_2\mathbf j+p_0q_3\mathbf k \\[1em]
            \notag &\quad +\ p_1q_0\mathbf i + p_1q_1\mathbf i^2+p_1q_2\mathbf i\mathbf j + p_1q_3\mathbf i\mathbf
            k\\[1em]
            \notag &\quad +\ p_2q_0\mathbf j + p_2q_1\mathbf j\mathbf i + p_2q_2\mathbf j^2 + p_2q_3\mathbf j\mathbf
            k\\[1em]
            &\quad +\ p_3q_0\mathbf k + p_3q_1\mathbf k\mathbf i + p_3q_1\mathbf k\mathbf j + p_3q_3 \mathbf k^2.
            \end{align}
            $$
        </div>
        <p>Using our definition statement in equations 1 and 2 we can simplify this rather lengthy expression
            byreplacing imaginary squares with \(-1\), and products of different imaginary numbers with the single
            imaginary number they correspond to according to equation 2. We also group all terms involving \( \mathbf
            i\) together, and likewise for \(\mathbf j\) and \(\mathbf k\).</p>
        <div class="eq">
            $$
            \begin{align}
            \notag pq &= p_0q_0 - p_1q_1 - p_2q_2 - p_3q_3\\[1em]
            \notag &\quad +\ \mathbf i\left( p_0q_1 + p_1q_0 + p_2q_3 - p_3q_2 \right)\\[1em]
            \notag &\quad +\ \mathbf j\left( p_0q_2 - p_1q_3 + p_2q_0 + p_3q_1 \right)\\[1em]
            &\quad +\ \mathbf k\left( p_0q_3 + p_1q_2 - p_2q_1 + p_3q_0 \right)
            \end{align}
            $$
        </div>
        <p>From here on we can forget about the imaginary nature of \(\mathbf i, \mathbf j, \mathbf k\) and treat them
            simply as unit basis vectors in the four-dimensional quaternion space. The computer scientists among you may
            like to stop here, as this is the most conveniently-computable form of the product. For the mathematicians,
            it should be easy to convince yourself that the first line is just</p>
        <div class="eq">
            $$
            \begin{equation}
            p_0q_0 - \mathbf p\cdot\mathbf q,
            \end{equation}
            $$
        </div>
        <p>where \(\mathbf p\) is the vector part of \(p\) and \(\mathbf q\) is the vector part of \(q\). So</p>
        <div class="eq">
            $$
            \begin{align}
            \notag pq &= p_0q_0 - \mathbf p\cdot\mathbf q\\[1em]
            \notag &\quad +\ \mathbf i\left( p_0q_1 + p_1q_0 + p_2q_3 - p_3q_2 \right)\\[1em]
            \notag &\quad +\ \mathbf j\left( p_0q_2 - p_1q_3 + p_2q_0 + p_3q_1 \right)\\[1em]
            \label{quaternion-with-dot} &\quad +\ \mathbf k\left( p_0q_3 + p_1q_2 - p_2q_1 + p_3q_0 \right)
            \end{align}
            $$
        </div>
        <p>It's not quite as obvious how the remaining parts can be simplified, but those of you who have done enough
            linear algebra can probably sense a cross product trying to break out. Let's work out the cross product of
            two 3-vectors \(p\) and \(q\), and see if we can shake it loose.</p>
        <div class="eq">
            $$
            \begin{align}
            \nonumber\mathbf p\times\mathbf q &= \left|\begin{matrix}
            \mathbf i & \mathbf j & \mathbf k \\ p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ q_1 & q_2 & q_3
            \end{matrix}\right| \\[1em]
            &=
            \mathbf i\left( p_2q_3 - p_3q_2 \right)
            -\mathbf j\left( p_1q_3 - p_3q_1 \right)
            +\mathbf k\left( p_1q_2 - p_2q_1 \right).
            \end{align}
            $$
        </div>
        <p>Now that we have it here for comparison, we can see that the cross product is indeed present in equation 7,
            but it doesn't account for all the terms. Let's write it in and see what we're left with.</p>
        <div class="eq">
            $$
            \begin{align}
            \nonumber pq &= p_0q_0 - \mathbf p\cdot\mathbf q + \mathbf p\times\mathbf q \\[1em]
            \nonumber &\quad +\ \mathbf i\left( p_0q_1 + p_1q_0\right) \\[1em]
            \nonumber &\quad +\ \mathbf j\left( p_0q_2 + p_2q_0 \right) \\[1em]
            &\quad +\ \mathbf k\left( p_0q_3 + p_3q_0 \right)
            \end{align}
            $$
        </div>
        <p>By collecting together all the terms containing \(p_0\), and all the terms containing \(q_0\), we can see
            that we have a term \(p_0q = p_0(q_1\mathbf i+q_2\mathbf j+q_3 \mathbf k)\), and a similar term q₀p.
            Therefore we can write what remains as a couple of scalar multiples of the vector parts of our quaternions.
            This is the result:</p>
        <div class="eq">
            $$
            \begin{align}
            pq &= p_0q_0 - \mathbf p\cdot\mathbf q + \mathbf p\times\mathbf q
            + p_0\mathbf q + q_0 \mathbf p.
            \end{align}
            $$
        </div>
        <p>This is about the best we can do, and it is the canonical quaternion product. You're probably not looking
            forward to doing any quaternion calculations by hand, and that's pretty reasonable of you. If you're like me
            you're probably having flashbacks to inverting a 4x4 matrix, or something along those lines. Luckily there
            aren't really any contexts outside of education where you'd ever need to do this by hand. The most common
            use of quaternions is in computing 3D rotations in computer graphics, or in electromechanical settings where
            you need to track the orientation of something in 3-dimensional space. In both of those situations you will
            certainlybe using a computer to do all the calculating.</p>
        <h3>Visual multiplication</h3>
        <p>If you'd like a more visual way to follow the terms through this multiplication, consider the following
            table.</p>
        <table class="quaternion-product">
            <tr>
                <td>\(\times\)</td>
                <td>\(p_0\)</td>
                <td>\(p_1\mathbf i\)</td>
                <td>\(p_2\mathbf j\)</td>
                <td>\(p_3\mathbf k\)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>\(q_0\)</td>
                <td class="grey">\(p_0q_0\)</td>
                <td class="blue1">\(p_1q_0\mathbf i\)</td>
                <td class="blue1">\(p_2q_0\mathbf j\)</td>
                <td class="blue1">\(p_3q_0\mathbf k\)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>\(q_1\mathbf i\)</td>
                <td class="blue2">\(p_0q_1\mathbf i\)</td>
                <td class="red">\(-p_1q_1\)</td>
                <td class="green1">\(-p_2q_1\mathbf k\)</td>
                <td class="green2">\(p_3q_1\mathbf j\)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>\(q_2\mathbf j\)</td>
                <td class="blue2">\(p_0q_2\mathbf j\)</td>
                <td class="green1">\(p_1q_2\mathbf k\)</td>
                <td class="red">\(-p_2q_2\)</td>
                <td class="green3">\(-p_3q_2\mathbf i\)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>\(q_3\mathbf k\)</td>
                <td class="blue2">\(p_0q_3\mathbf k\)</td>
                <td class="green2">\(-p_1q_3\mathbf j\)</td>
                <td class="green3">\(p_2q_3\mathbf i\)</td>
                <td class="red">\(-p_3q_3\)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The blue shaded regions are \(p_0q\) and \(q_0p\). The red region is \(-\mathbf p\cdot \mathbf q\). The three
            green regions are the three terms of the cross product \(p\times q\). The grey region is the remaining
            scalar term p₀q₀. The sum of all these regions is the full quaternion product. The algebra might have made
            it seem like some terms came out of nowhere, but hopefully the table helps convince you there's no magic
            involved.</p>
        <h3>Quaternions for rotation</h3>
        <p>If you're here at all, you're almost certainly aware that the main practical use of quaternions is for
            computing 3D rotations without having to fight the limitations of Euler angles. I will be discussing
            rotations in another article.</p>
        <h3>C++ quaternion library</h3>
        <p>As part of my journey to understand quaternions, I wrote a header-only C++ library which you can find here:
